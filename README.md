# Marc's Shiny Project: Beta Explorer
link: https://marcsprojects.shinyapps.io/shinyproject/

This tool allows users to better understand how the price of a chosen stock moves relative to the market (beta) and its sector.  For the purposes of this analysis, five variables are considered: Market Cap, Price to Earnings Ratio, Revenue Growth, Financial Leverage (as measured by Total Debt / EBITDA), and Dividend Yield.

Depending on the sector, each of these factors appears to influence relative performance in different, and sometimes surprising, ways.
